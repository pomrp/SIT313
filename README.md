project name : The window of Chinese culture

Project Description: The application I have decided to create is called “The window of Chinese culture”. The purpose of this app is drawing in large foreigners to interest in China. Also, let the traveler has more choices to travel in China. As an Chinese international student, I would like to build a simple app to introduce my home country’s culture. When users start the app, the screen will display splash screen with logo, and when users enter the app user can view the first main page, the first main page display the menu of the app, users can press different buttons to view different pages with Chinese culture information and images. Because it is a native app which I don’t want to add too many hard features in my app. Also, there is a feedback page, which let users write the feedback for this app. in this app, it will have clearing navigation bar for users. This is an easy app, users just need take few minutes to know how to use it and read the app content. My application does provide all the features for free.	

Target audience : foreigners who wants to know and intresent in about China.
